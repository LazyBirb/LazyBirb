Just give it a shot, you might like coding!


Hey, Im LazyBirbo, I'm mainly active on BedrockConnect and private Repositories, I code in Java and C# and still actively learning them!


Problems with the BedrockConnect instance? Read [this!](https://github.com/LazyBirb/LazyBirb/blob/master/bedrockconnect/README.MD)


I run the BedrockConnect instance because of passion, if you want to support me by keeping the server running you can donate me over PayPal [Paypal.me/lazibirbo/](https://paypal.me/lazibirbo)
