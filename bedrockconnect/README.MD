# Public hosted BedrockConnect Instance
Hello everyone, i've been hosting a [BedrockConnect](https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect) Instance with a DNS Service and [MCXboxBroadcast](https://github.com/rtm516/MCXboxBroadcast) for some while and I'm happy for everyone that had made these programs and to you for using it!

But sadly nothing is perfect and things can break and crash. So if you find a problem on the BedrockConnect instance of mine, then create a issue on this Repository.

## BedrockConnect is outdated/not responding!
**The Server restart every day at 5AM GMT+2** to avoid any problems with other programs, the **BedrockConnect restarts every day at 6AM and 10PM GMT+2** to update itself and the MCXboxBroadcast! 
## Still not fixed? Create a issue [HERE!](https://github.com/LazyBirb/LazyBirb/issues/new/choose)
To keep everything organised and my inboxes not overfilled I decided to take the problems for the instance over GitHub as issues. In general it's for me and others easier to sort and resolve these problems, because sometimes these errors aren't due to the instance.
