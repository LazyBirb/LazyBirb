# Public hosted BedrockConnect Instance
Hello everyone, i've been hosting a [BedrockConnect](https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect) Instance with a DNS Service and [MCXboxBroadcast](https://github.com/rtm516/MCXboxBroadcast) for some while and I'm happy for everyone that had made these programs and to you for using it!

But sadly nothing is perfect and things can break and crash. So if you find a problem on the BedrockConnect instance of mine, then create a issue on this repo! 

## BedrockConnect is outdated/not responding!
The Server was scripted to restart every day at 5AM GMT+2 to avoid any problems with other programs, the BedrockConnect instance is suppose to restart every day at 6AM and 10PM GMT+2 to update itself and the MCXboxBroadcast! But if you find there is still an error with that then create a issue! Just avoid having duplicates for the same version!
