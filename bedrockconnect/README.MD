# Public hosted BedrockConnect instance 


***NOTE**: The Join-Over-Friend method is currently broken as of version 1.21.20, and is being looked into. Use DNS method for now.*

## BedrockConnect is outdated/not responding!
Have you checked the status pages? Please check the [Public hosted status page](https://bcstatus.xyz/status/bedrock) and [my status page](https://status.lazybirbo.de/status/all) for any downtime!

**The Server restart every day at 5AM GMT+2** to avoid any problems with other programs, **BedrockConnect restarts every day at 6AM and 10PM GMT+2** to update itself and the MCXboxBroadcast! 

## How do I connect/use it properly?

 - DNS: 45.88.109.66 (Please refer to the original guide [here](https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect?tab=readme-ov-file#tutorials), but instead use the 45.88.109.66 IP as your primary DNS Server)
 - ~~Friends: Add the Xbox user **McBEFC** to your friends and wait a moment, after a while the account adds you back and shows itself playing Minecraft Bedrock, if you join this accounts world, you'll get redirected to my BedrockConnect instance.~~
## About my instance
Hello everyone, i've been hosting a [BedrockConnect](https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect) Instance with a DNS Service and [MCXboxBroadcast](https://github.com/rtm516/MCXboxBroadcast) for some while and I'm thankful for everyone that had made these programs and to you for using it!

But sadly nothing is perfect and things can break and crash. So if you find a problem on the BedrockConnect instance of mine, then create a issue on this Repository.

## Still not fixed? Create a issue [HERE!](https://github.com/LazyBirb/LazyBirb/issues/new/choose)

To keep everything organised and my inboxes not overfilled I decided to take the problems for the instance over GitHub as issues. In general it's for me and others easier to sort and resolve these problems, because sometimes these errors aren't due to the instance.
